I have put screenshots of every single theme which awesome dev @adi1090x has provided into this folder.
How I managed to do that? Well check out the ProjectTermuxThemesPreviews, it is written in bash.
Screenshots have theme name as their file names.
The theme names are printed in imagez themselves as well.
I will do same thing for fonts if my pull request is accepted.
Again many many congratulations to awesome dev @adi1090x for this wonderful applet he has created.
