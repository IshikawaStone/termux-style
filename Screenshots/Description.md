I have put screenshots of every single theme which awesome dev @adi1090x has provided into this folder.
How I managed to do that? Well check out the ProjectTermuxThemesPreviews, it is written in bash.
Screenshots have theme name as their file names.
Alice story is used just to show beauty of each theme, termux-style file was edited for that.It can be checked out in the 'Screeshots' folder. Some more  little modifications were made so that it coul'd function properly, like $HOME was chaged to actual full path, and some others here and there. Use of this 'termux-style is highly deprecated, since it was ported to run with system bin files.

The theme names are printed in images themselves as well.
I will do same thing for fonts if my pull request is accepted.
Again many many congratulations to awesome dev @adi1090x for this wonderful applet he has created.
